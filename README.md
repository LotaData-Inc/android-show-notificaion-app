-   **Engagement Workflow**: Choreograph the work required to design and execute mobile engagement, including tasks, responsibilities and timelines.
    
-   **Unlimited Geofences:** GeoSDK is the world's first SDK and mobile engagement platform that shifts the trigger logic and push capability to the mobile device. The cloud is a key part of the equation, but Edge Push Intelligence brings flexibility and freedom like no other push service on the market. Edge Push Intelligence also frees the device from the Android OS limits and allows developers to push contextual messages targeting thousands of geo-fences. In other words: we don't use [Google Geofence API](https://developers.google.com/location-context/geofencing)!

-   **Real-Time Engagement:** Deliver real-time mobile engagement via push notifications, based on customer or segment insights (prior to an engagement) combined with information gleaned during an engagement.
    
-   **Movement Triggers:** Trigger mobile engagements based on user activity information, like walking, driving, running, or still.
    
-   **Location Triggers:** Leverage real-time location information as well as historical location profile about a mobile user to trigger relevant engagements.
    
-   **No FCM Required:** GeoSDK is FCM-free. In other words, while we integrate with Google, we do not use Firebase Cloud Messaging service. Our push service is powered by LOTaDATA's cloud infrastructure which gives us infinite control and enables us to offer our clients a very unique set of features including Edge Push Intelligence.
